The notion of profitability is often overlooked when defining the scope of an internal audit assignment. However, it is often an indicator of the health of the company and its good governance. Profitability largely depends on the use of the available resources.
The resources of a bank, which are mainly financial (equity, customer deposits, interbank loans, bonds, certificates of deposit), allow it to operate its primary activity, financing project ; whether personal or professional, on short or medium-long term. However these financial resources are limited. Moreover “capital requirements”, which are expressed as a percentage of assets (interbank loans, customer credit, securities and fixed assets) weighted according to risk, is an additional constraint to their usage. Therefore the management of these resources is one of the pillars of the bank's commercial strategy.

#### **The pricing structure**
Thus, banks will most likely favor the most profitable markets by dedicating the largest share of resources  (credit). However, beyond the market dimension, the pricing applied by the bank may vary from one counterpart to another. It is formalized through a tariff schedule which takes into account at least the following indicators :

- The Market (Individuals, Professionals, Companies, City Government, etc.) ;
- The counterparty risk rating ;
- The nature of the operation ;
- The amount of the operation.

Beyond the latter, the balance of power between the bank and its client has also a decisive impact on the bank proposal. This balance can be defined by multiple criteria such as :

- The **competitors** (other banking establishments) ;
- The **attractiveness of the counterparty** which itself rely on :
    - the business relationship prospects (cashflows, credit, developing a business relationship with the other entities of the group, etc.) ;
    - the brand ;
    - the bank’s strategy (conquering new market/ maintaining its position) ;
    - etc.

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

#### **Process, rules and limits, and control**
Sometimes, the bank will have a trade balance deficit with its counterpart ; this situation is often linked to one or more loans whose tariff conditions are lower than the bank's refinancing rate [^bignote1]. If at first glance it appears as an economic nonsense, the bank may have established a strategy aiming to attract **attractive counterparts** through significant tariff concessions, in particular when it seeks to expand its customer portfolio.
In order to be economically viable, a **pricing policy** must be established allowing the implementation of a decision-making process (e.g .: delegation levels based on the position occupied),  limits as well as supervision of employee action (controls).
Moreover, the exception should not apply rather than the rule. Thus, both a monitoring system (reporting) and a control system (1st and 2nd level) must be implemented and enforced at a regular frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.). Through these actions management will be able to ensure compliance with established procedures and rules and ultimately the defined strategy.

#### **The auditor role**
However, the auditor's approach should not be limited to the **assessment of the internal control system** and/or the **existence and reliability of the reporting** to the governance. In addition, the auditor must ensure the implementation of a **strategy** which is consistent with the market and the economic prospects. For example :

- Maintaining accounts remunerated at high rates is questionable when central bank interest rates are low or negative ;
- The attractivity of the counterparty must be justified based on facts and consistent regarding the company's risk policy. Thus a counterparty from a sector to which the bank wishes to reduce its exposure, or presenting a high risk, should not be the subject of a preferential tariff ;
- Etc.

Thus, *"Most chief audit executives anticipate that internal audit will go beyond its traditional 'assurance' mission to evolve into a role of strategic advisor"* [^bignote2].
