The audit is a periodic control function. Its analysis takes place after customer’s onboarding and/or funding of a customer's project. The audit function is following a cycle ranging from 3 to 5 years. 
Time and resources constraint the audit mission and require checks done by the team to be carried out on the basis of samples. The latters must be **representative of the studied population**, as well as, **relevant with regard to the risks specific to the population**. The most commonly used criteria will be as follows :

 - The most **significant business activities within the Bank's client portfolio** (concentration risk) ;
 - The  most **sensitive business activities to the risk of default**[^bignote1] ;
 - The counterparties or group of counterparties with the most **significant debt within the Bank's client portfolio** (concentration risk) ;
 - The **risk rating** of the counterparty or group of counterparties (Bank and/or Banque de France risk rating)[^bignote2] ;
 - The existence of **adverse information** on a counterparty or a group of counterparties regarding its ability to honor its engagements at short or medium-long term (fraud, regulatory changes, economic sanctions, etc.).
 
Beyond the counterparty risk, the concentration risk analysis should also be taken into account when analyzing the Bank's strategy on the medium and large enterprises market. It is a major issue that cannot be overlooked when defining the sample. The overrepresentation of a counterparty or a business activity within the Bank's client portfolio weakens the Bank’s resilience to the default risk. The adverse impact of a counterparty (loss, business continuity, etc.) is proportional to its debt in the books of the Bank.
