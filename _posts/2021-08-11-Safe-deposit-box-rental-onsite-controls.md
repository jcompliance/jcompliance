#### **Important concerns**  
The audit controls of the safe deposit boxes rental service involves an important part of on-site inspections. While the inventory of keys, as well as, the opening of a sample of unrented safe deposit boxes are fundamental, it will also be necessary to pay particular attention to the following points :

 - The keys of the unrented safe deposit boxes or used by the bank are stored in a secure space in an orderly manner and their location is known of the branch employees ;
 - The employees are aware of the  list of the safe deposit boxes and their status (rented / unrented / used / out of order) and can access to it ;
 - The procedures regarding the safe deposit boxes rental service are accessible and known (access to the vault, marketing, etc.) ;
 - The past incidents observed in the last 6 months (customer or staff blocked in the vault, safes out of order, etc.) ;
 - The state of the vault (ease of access, cleanliness, video protection).
