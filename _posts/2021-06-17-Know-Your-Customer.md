*As a disclaimer, It is important to note that this essay will mainly deal with controls related to KYC (Know Your Customer) as part of an audit of the Corporate and Medium-sized Enterprises' market.*

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

"Control table - Knowing your customer : supporting documents" below intends to help the auditor in evaluating the presence and conformity of the documents necessary to ensure the Bank’s customer knowledge. In addition to it, the website of Infogreffe[^bignote1], clerk of french commercial courts, makes it possible to ensure that the documents and information collected are compliant and up to date. It also offers the possibility to acquire the necessary supporting documents.  Moreover, as part of controls dedicated to KYC, the auditor will also ensure the quality of the data input into the information system[^bignote2]. However due to audit constraints (time, audit plan, etc.), this control will not always be included into an mission of the Corporate and Medium-sized Enterprises' market. 

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

**Control table - Knowing your customer : supporting documents** 

The auditor will control both the presence and the conformity (relevance and updating) of the supporting documents. Its results can be shown in a table reporting, among other things, the following items, namely :

- regarding KYC: a K-BIS, the up-to-date *Statuts*[^bignote3], a Proof of Identity for the executive(s) (Identity card, passport, etc.), and the last Financial Statements (Balance Sheet and Income Statement) ;
 - regarding the Ultimate Beneficial Owners: the List of the Beneficial Owners and a Proof of Identity for the Beneficial Owners, (Identity card, passport, etc.) ;
- regarding Persons authorized to operate accounts: an Authorization(s) and the scope of powers, a Proof of identity (Identity card, passport, etc.) and a Specimen(s) of signature.

*Nota Bene : To assess the quality of the items collected by the Bank, the auditor can use a drop-down list, via the data and data validation tabs, including, for example :*

 - *“Yes” / “No” ;*
 - *“Present and compliant” / “present and non-compliant” / “absent”, the last two indicating non-compliance to KYC regulation ;*
 - *etc.*

#### **Additional information**

*"The verification of the identity of a client, a legal person, rely on the transmission of an original or a copy of any deed or extract from the official register dated less than three months, or extracted from the Official Journal notifying the **name**, the **legal form**, the **address of the registered office** and the **identity of partners and executives**, as well as of the **legal representatives** or their equivalents in foreign law. This is, for example [...] for a company* :

 - *A **K-bis extract** less than 3 months old [...]* ;
 - *For a company established abroad, a record from a register or a certificate of legal validity of the company and, where applicable, a translation or a certificate of incorporation (Certificate of incorporation) supplemented by other documents enabling the collection of all required informations."*[^bignote4]

The powers delegated to the person acting on behalf of the client must also be verified. To this end, a document justifying his role as a representative must therefore be obtained, such as :

 - The ***Statuts***[^bignote3] of the company or a formal delegation of power ;
 - The communication of a K-bis extract of less than 3 months may be sufficient when the company is established in France and the function of the representative of the legal person appearing on this document makes it possible to determine the powers attached to it. 

The documentation presenting the **financial situation** of the legal entity is part of the documents to be gathered (annual accounts, tax return). In addition, financial organizations also collect and analyze any other relevant information using a risk-based approach, for example the main suppliers or customers of the company (accounts payable, accounts receivable). 
The update of the documents relating to customer knowledge takes place in the event of a significant change in the business relationship (change of beneficial owner, subscription to a new product / service, etc.), or even, if necessary, to for the purpose of processing an alert or as part of an enhanced review. Appropriate internal control measures must ensure the compliance with this updating obligation.
