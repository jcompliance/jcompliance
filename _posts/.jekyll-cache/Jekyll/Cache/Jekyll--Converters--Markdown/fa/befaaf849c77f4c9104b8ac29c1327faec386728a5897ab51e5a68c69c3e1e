I"“<p>This title is a christmas gift from my husband back in 2017. Itâ€™s a shame Iâ€™ve never played the game since then but working from home life and all the rules that gets stricter and stricter with time about going outside made me explore the game finally, and it was a brilliant idea. The game is extremely beautiful and well made.</p>

<p>The scenery in the game is literally amazing. While you canâ€™t travel for fun or explore new forests or something, Zelda gives you temporary relief by its beautiful graphicâ€¦</p>

<p>The game is open world based so I can explore anything Iâ€™d like to do. Itâ€™s all about what you want to do, Itâ€™s not like you have only one way to solve a problem you would face, instead you can think out of the box.</p>

<p>Horses you can discover and tame, they are lovely. Itâ€™s a shame that if theyâ€™re injured or damaged, you canâ€™t heal them. And I donâ€™t really like to battle in the game so I wish I couldâ€™ve been able toâ€¦ tame even that goblins.</p>

<p>My progress is not so much yet and it means I have so much more to enjoy. My husband tells me itâ€™d take years for me to clear all.</p>
