It takes a bit of time until the recording gets uploaded to Cloudflare partner portal - please understand me using my personal github page to distribute the video quicker.

I've done the pre-sales engineer enablement webinar for our APAC partners. The recording is following, powered by Cloudflare Stream.

Thanks a lot everyone for your participation. [It will be great to have your feedback for our further coursework improvement.](https://forms.gle/v6EtWSjwwngbCVEy8)
