#### **The main principles of risk analysis**

The analysis of the default risk of a counterparty, such as a large or medium-sized company, in the context of granting short or medium-term credit, is based on 5 main components :

- Historical financial statements performance ;
- Business strategy and industry’s key success factors ;
- Management capability ;
- Competitors’ performance, competitive pressure and macroeconomic environment ; 
- Terms and conditions in the loan agreements (guarantees, insurance, etc.).

While the understanding of the financial statements is fundamental in order to assess the risk, it is only one of the components of the analysis that will have to be carried out. Thus, the presence of an expert profession within the audit team is dispensable in the context of the analysis and assessment of the risks of a counterparty or of a group of counterparties. However  it appears necessary regarding supervision of the audit assignment.
 

#### **Targeting your analysis, e.g. a corporate group**

The time devoted by the auditor to carrying out his various checks is limited and must therefore be optimized. In the example of a corporate group, it is therefore important to identify core entities. To do so, the auditor must identify:

- the entities belonging to the group, their economic activity, as well as the economic relations/agreements existing between them;
- their revenue as well as their debt.

Thus, the development of an organizational chart is the easiest way to achieve this objective:

In view of the diagram above, the ABC group is specialized in manufacturing furniture. It is  composed of 3 entities including a holding and *Company A* which controls 2 subsidiaries, *Company B* and *Company C*. Their activity (sawing and planing of wood, manufacturing furniture) help us to understand the economic links regulating the group :

 - *Company B* processes the wood that will be used by *Company C*, its sole client, for manufacturing furnitures ;
 - Part (or all) of the income earned by these companies is subsequently returned to the holding for the repayment of its debt and the distribution of dividends from shareholders.

*Company C* is central in this organization, through the revenue it represents (€ 100 million vs. € 50 million and € 5 million), as well as, its role in the production chain. Therefore, even if the Bank’s credit risk rely on *Company A* (80%), the auditor's analysis will focus on *Company C*.

*Note Bene2 : the risk rating assigned by the Bank, as well as the Banque de France rating, have to be considered for each counterpart when analyzing a corporate group regarding the adverse impacts that may arise from a single entity. However, this must first and foremost be taken into account when defining the counterparty sample to be assessed.*
*Note Bene3 : Appendices 17 and 18 of the tax package, as well as modules 51, 53, 56 57, 58 and 59 of the Fichier Bancaire des ENtreprise de la Banque de France (FIBEN), will provide most of the elements necessary for the realization of an organization chart.*

#### **Financial analysis**

###### *Which documents and for what purpose*

A relevant financial analysis of a company requires the **financial statements** for the last 3 years ; this document is composed of the balance sheet, the income statement and their appendices.
The **Statutory Audit Report** is also essential, when it is required by law[^bignote1]. In the latter the statutory auditor guarantees the sincerity and the conformity of the financial statements prepared by the company but also reports events or circumstances identified likely to call into question the business continuity. Thus, the presence of any adverse information could have a major impact on the auditor's risk assessment.
On the other hand, the auditor should not limit himself to identify and understand the evolutions and trends on the most significant items, but also to ensure the consistency of these numbers by comparing **financial statements** of the company to these **of other companies with equivalent characteristics** (size, market). Thus this approach  can help to detect competitive advantages/disadvantages and guide the auditor in his assessment.
It is also important to note that intergroup relationships may distort the understanding of the financial statements of an entity which belong to a group. Reading the consolidated accounts, when they are available [^bignote2] will solve this problem. Otherwise, the analysis of the accounts receivable ledger could be an alternative.

#### **Company strategy**

Assessing a company's strategy requires, beforehand, to identify and understand industry’s key success factors. They will vary from one market to another and are bound to change over time, however we can mention as examples :

- Technological developments, such as the arrival of Smartphones in the field of telephony;
- Consumption trends, such as quality (premium quality) or environmental (organic) labels;
- Impact of regulatory changes, such as noise cancel or CO2 emission that impact the factory and transport sectors;
- Or other aspects such as the size (median, average) of the total balance sheet or turnover, as well as the company’s workforce, etc.

When reading the annual report of the company, the note and memos of the portfolio manager or through his interview, the auditor will ensure the company takes these key factors into consideration when establishing its medium/long-term roadmap, in particular regarding its investment strategy.
There are other elements to be appreciated such as the diversity of the customer portfolio. The concentration of sales or income, whether in a geographical area, sector of activity or from a limited number of customers, creates dependency likely to call into question the continuity of the activity if the commercial relationship went to collapse, extinguish or diminish due to sanctions affecting the home country of the company or the customer (e.g. customs barriers, export ban), the collapse of the business sector, or the default of the customer. However, this situation is not inescapable and can be compensated by deploying a strategy to conquer new markets.
* Note Bene: the auditor bases his analysis on sectoral studies carried out beforehand by the Bank (Credit Department or Risk Department) or third parties such as XERFI[^bignote3].*

#### **Management capacity**

The management of a company plays a major role in its success. The decisions he makes, and will be called upon to make, will have a direct impact on its future. Thus, the ** knowledge ** by the manager ** of the market **, in which the company operates, as well as his professional experience are key factors in establishing a strategy which will ensure its sustainability. On the other hand, the ** presence of adverse information ** must also be known from the Bank. The prohibition to manage, the exercise of management function in companies in difficulty or failing are all risk factors which the auditor must ensure the awareness of when decisions are made by the Bank.

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

#### **The performance of competing companies and the macroeconomic environment**

Beyond the elements mentioned above, the positioning of the company vis-à-vis its competitors is also an element of attention. Positive financial results, a coherent strategy, as well as a capable management team do not protect a company from disappearing in the medium/long term. Low **market shares** reduce a company's room for maneuver and weaken it vis-à-vis its competitors. Thus a niche positioning, namely **specialization** or hyperspecialization, on a specific product or service can thus be a viable solution due to the absence of direct competitors.
On the other hand the **firm size**, whether through its sales or total balance sheet regarding its competitors, also plays a major role. Smaller-sized companies have more limited resources (cash, guarantees, etc.) which reduce their capacity to invest in new technologies necessary for their survival or to cope with ** economic downturns ** (economic crises, customs barriers, etc.).
Sectoral analysis[^bignote3] mentioned above will help the auditor to understand the positioning of a company vis-à-vis its competitors.

#### **Appreciate the quality of guarantees**

The default of the counterparty is an eventuality which must be considered by the Bank and from which it can protect itself by taking collateral and/or sharing the credit risk with a third party. The presence of a valuable guarantee can therefore make the extension of a loan to a counterparty with a high risk of default (eg: new activity) an operation with controlled risk. For this, various elements must be assessed, on the first hand the **real value** of the collateral, and on the second hand its **liquidity**.
The **real value** should be assessed considering the company's default is due to its inability to create enough revenue to ensure the continuity of its activity. However, the real value of certain assets is directly correlated to the performance of the company. For example, the value of a store[^bignote4] of a failing company may have a real value close to zero ; a poor geographic location and/or a limited clientele will have no interest to a potential buyer. Another example are company shares. 
Assets such as real estate, vehicle or assembly line, can present a risk regarding to their **liquidity**. An asset is considered to be liquid when it can be bought or sold quickly without major impact on its price. The existence of a market, as well as the ability of the Bank to find a buyer, must therefore be assessed. For example, the sale of a good such as an assembly line built to meet a very specific customer need, can lead to:

- the scrapping of part of the elements that constitute it;
- and/or the use of an intermediary specialized in the sale of this type of goods.

Thus the proceeds of the sale and/or the costs associated with it (fees, commissions) may be insufficient to cover the debt left by the customer.
