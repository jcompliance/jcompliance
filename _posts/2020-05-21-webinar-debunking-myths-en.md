I've filmed a Korean webinar on 21 May about [Cloudflare Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/). With this product, you can get a score info based on possibility of whether the particular request is coming from human through browsers, or from automated scripts, malicious bots. You can set your security rules based on this score. I was happy to have a chance to introduce this product as I personally like it. The product is available only for the enterprise customers.

Given that you're reading this English page you may not understand my Korean webinar. 
If you're interested in the contents, do have a look at our [English version of the same webinar here](https://www.cloudflare.com/webinars/debunking-myths-about-malicious-bots/), filmed by my colleague in the US.
If you're just curious how my Korean version of the webinar sounds like, [there you go.](https://www.cloudflare.com/webinars/debunking-myths-about-malicious-bots-kr/)
