The rental of safe deposit boxes is one of the historical activities of the network bank. However, digitization and the evolution of banking practices have gradually led to a **reduction of the retail banking network** ; the latter affecting de facto the number of available vault rooms.
Thus “*[France] had 41,800 [bank branches] in 2010, against 38,100 in 2020*”[^bignote1]. In addition, the **low use of bank safe deposit boxes** (on average 50%, source Les Echos) has led banking establishments to reorganize this activity by concentrating it within dedicated branches. Denis Mancosu, multichannel distribution director at Caisses d'Epargne, explained to Les Echos newspaper that “*[previously] we had one vault room per branch, [while] today only 15% of our points of sale are equipped*”[^bignote2].
The low usage of a service does not foster learning or **mastering of the procedures** dedicated to it. However, the latter affect both the marketing of safe deposit boxes (customer identification, compliance with contracts, etc.), and access to the safe room (register of visits, access, surveillance and security rules, risk indicators AML/CFT[^bignote3], etc.), as well as their management (inventory and conservation of keys, room maintenance, etc.). Their ignorance does not allow or support the effort to manage risks (compliance, AML/CFT, image, etc.), on the contrary, it favors their occurence[^bignote4].

In addition, **regulatory changes** have established new constraints for banking establishments over the past years.
The french Monetary and Financial Code requires the **identification of holders of safe deposit boxes**, individual[^bignote5] or legal persons[^bignote6], as well as the recording and storage of data in electronic form without time limit for rented safes and for one to eight days for closed accounts and safes[^bignote7].
**Access to the safe** must also be monitored by the banking institution. Frequent visits and/or for a long period (custody of large amounts of cash) are signs that should alert the establishment to the use of its services for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing. Additional red flags are, for example :

 - Often visiting the safe deposit box before making cash deposits of sums under the reporting threshold ;
 - Rental of multiple safe deposit boxes by the same holder or members of the same family (spouse, kids) ;
 - etc.

The "Eckert" law, which entered into force on January 1st 2016, defines the **inactivity** of a bank account or **safe deposit box**[^bignote8] and the management rules that apply to the banking institution. Thus, when a safe is considered inactive, the credit institution must search for the holder who may have died. He informs the latter, his legal representative, the person authorized by him or, where applicable, his known beneficiaries, of any upcoming consequences. These operations must be renewed every five years from the date of the first unpaid. At the expiration of a period of twenty years from the date of the first unpaid, the establishment is then authorized to open the safe deposit box and either to liquidate the securities deposited in the safe or to have the goods deposited in the safe sold by public auction. The proceeds of the sale, excluding any penalties and late interest and costs associated with opening the safe and selling the goods, are acquired by the french State.

The evolution of people's habits, as well as, regulatory changes have impacted the profitability of safe deposit boxes rental activity. It is therefore important that a reflection has been carried out regarding its evolution (shutdown, transformation) in order to develop and implement a relevant strategy regarding both commercial and regulatory issues ; a dormant management no longer needs to be. A vault room is a space which requires its own management which cannot be the same as a classic retail branch (monitoring, access, maintenance, dedicated staff or referent, etc.) and whose strategy must be established Bank-wide and not just at the branch network scale.
