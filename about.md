# Jean Ryu

A good day to you! My name is Jean Ryu and I love solving problems with proper solutions.

I am currently a solutions engineer at `Cloudflare`. Cloudflare helps build a better internet, meaning safer, faster and more reliable. Cloudflare's network, AS13335 is one of the most-interconnected network in the world. Here I am helping our enterprise clients quantify business pain points, come up with the best solutions, onboard with the solution by implementing/integrating. I also help our clients get trained with the platform so they can extract the most value of Cloudflare.

Before joining Cloudflare, I've stayed with `Korea Internet & Security Agency` based out of Seoul, South Korea. KISA takes care of Korea's ccTLD(.kr, .한국) and new gTLD operations as well as cybersecurity regulations such as ISMS. I was part of technical operations team and took care of datacenter & network operations of .kr DNS network, and IPv6 based IX (AS17832). I was in charge of security operations as well when KISA KRNIC's operaions underwent security audits/compliances. 

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time in learning new languages. I am native in Korean and fluent in English. I learned Japanese, Chinese(Mandarin) and French for fun. Although none of the three is great in business level (yet) in Japanese I can communicate pretty freely, also can watch programs without subtitle. In Chinese and French I can briefly introduce myself and survive in country without speaking English. I also enjoy traveling. I dream of crossing Eurasian continent only by train someday - my current footprint can be found [here][travel-map].
